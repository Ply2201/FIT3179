            <p style="padding: 0 4px">This web based visualisation makes use of data that has been collected over the years by researchers and academics from the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland. The data covers from the year 2001 onwards to understand how the September 11 attacks and the beginning of the Global War on Terror has affected terrorism cases worldwide. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="pure-u-1-4">
            <p style="padding: 0 4px">The map to the right presents the civilian death toll around the globe due to terrorist attacks. Colour hue is used to present the death toll with darker the shade denoting a higher number of civilian casualties. Note that while the United States is shown to be one of the countries with a rather significantly high death toll, approximately 73% of the death toll came solely from the September 11 attacks in New York, Virginia and Pennsylvania.  </p>  
      </div>
      <div class="pure-u-1-4">
            <p style="padding: 0 4px"> When studying terrorism attacks, grouping the countries by region can be useful in seeing the bigger picture. It is clear from the world map to the right that the Middle East & North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, and a large portion Asia suffers heavily from terrorist attacks. These number are likely heavily influenced by geopolitical events such as the Arab Spring unrest, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and Islamic Extremism and Insurgencies in South and South East Asia.</p>

      <div class="pure-u-1-4">
            <p style="padding: 0 4px"> Below, the bar graph shows the death toll of civilians in what are considered to be the hot regions for terrorist attacks. It is clear that the Middle East, Africa and South Asia are the regions most impacted. Beside it, we can see that bombs, armed assaults and assasinations are the most frequent types of attacks.</p>

            <h2>Civilians Wounded By Terrorism Over Time</h2>
            <p>Although an alarming number of civilians have been killed as a direct result of terrorism, an even higher number were wounded. The bubble chart below visualises the number of civilians wounded over the years by terrorism grouped by region. Note that while most regions maintain a somewhat consistent number of injuries over the years, the United States has a large anomly in 2001 due to the devastating September 11th attacks which saw over 8000 civilians and first responders injured.</p>

            <h2>Most Popular Weapons Used by Terrorists Over the Years</h2>
            <p>While the motives and politics behind acts of terrorism have evolved over the years, the weapons of choice remain rather consistent. The stacked bar chart to the right shows the number of civilians killed by each type weapons over the years. It is clear that explosives, firearms and incendiaries are the weapon of choice of many terrorist while thankfully, there are very few or non cases of biological, chemical or radiological weapons being utilised.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>It is clear that acts of terrorism has seen a steady increase after the Global War on Terror has begun. While there may have been a decline at first, civilian death toll as a direct result of terrorism has increased. It is clear that the top weapons of choice for terrorists are firearms, explosives and incendiaries and that armed assault, bombings and assasinations are the most common types of attacks.</p>
    <p>From the data, it is apparent that the Middle East, Africa and South Asia suffer the most from acts of terrorism while South America, Europe and Oceania are less likely to be targeted.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, it can be seen that for many regions such as the Middle East, Africa and South Asia, the number of civilian deaths and injuries are rather consistent over the years while regions. On the other hand, regions like North America have anomolies in the data set such as September 11 attacks where there is a large jump in death and injuries but have generally low numbers in other years.  </p>
